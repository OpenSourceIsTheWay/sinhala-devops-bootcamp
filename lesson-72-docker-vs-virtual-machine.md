os -> kernel layer, application layer, hardware

Linux distros use same linux kernel but different application UI

Docker virtualizes the application layer, VM virtualizes both kernel and application layer

docker images are much smaller.
docker container start and run much faster than Vms
docker containers with linux base images cannot run on windows. Docker toolbox makes it possible.
